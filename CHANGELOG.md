# Changelog

## 1.5.1

- Added automatic refresh for open documents changed or atomically replaced by another application, while preserving active source edits when changes conflict.
- Restored standard Markdown line-break behavior so ordinary newlines remain soft breaks and only trailing spaces or a backslash create visible hard breaks.

## 1.5.0

- Added an opt-in update setting for receiving GitHub pre-release builds and release candidates.
- Added native PDF and portable HTML export, an Open in Preview command, remembered export formats, and self-contained Mermaid and local-image output.
- Improved printed-document pagination by keeping headings with following content, preventing orphaned code-block borders, and wrapping long code lines for paper output.
- Enabled new Markdown documents with an editable starter, native untitled-document behavior, and links to the CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown references.
- Renamed the GitHub repository to MarkLens and corrected the app, Quick Look extension, and test bundle identifiers to use the `ch.doapp` namespace.
- Fixed unsupported Highlight.js languages on macOS and resolved Swift concurrency warnings ahead of Swift 6 migration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bundle identifier changed from `com.doapp.MarkLens` to `ch.doapp.MarkLens`. Existing users may need to reauthorize local folders and select MarkLens again as their default Markdown application.
