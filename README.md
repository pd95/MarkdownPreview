## Requirements

Development requires Xcode 26 running on a compatible version of macOS.

MarkLens supports:

- macOS 15.6 or later
- iOS 17.6 or later

## Build

Open the project:

```sh
open MarkLens.xcodeproj
```

Build the app from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project MarkLens.xcodeproj -scheme MarkLens -configuration Debug build
```

Build the Quick Look extension:

```sh
xcodebuild -project MarkLens.xcodeproj -scheme QuickLookPreview_macOS -configuration Debug build
```

## Test

Run the Markdown pipeline tests on any supported Swift development platform:

```sh
swift test --package-path MarkdownPipeline
```

Run the app unit and UI tests on macOS:

```sh
xcodebuild -project MarkLens.xcodeproj -scheme MarkLens -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

## Project Layout

- `MarkLens/` contains the SwiftUI app and app-specific web resources.
- `QuickLookPreview_macOS/` contains the macOS Quick Look extension.
- `MarkdownPipeline/` contains the shared Markdown renderer, bundled web assets, and pipeline tests.
- `Shared/` contains Swift code shared by the app and extension.
- `MarkLensTests/` and `MarkLensUITests/` contain app integration and UI tests.

## Future Tasks

- Consider adding a custom print panel accessory for header/footer toggles and margin presets.
